This includes three sets of data on non-coal foreign objects on the conveyor belt of the belt conveyor.
Data I was collected from Boshitong Co., Ltd. in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, while Data II and III were collected by Professor Zhang Mengchao from Shandong University of Science and Technology.
Due to interest relevance, approximately 500 images and labels were displayed, which can be used for training and testing of deep learning models.
In addition, the software and hardware environment we tested is:
  Windows 11; NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080; 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM)i7-11800H 2.30 GHz; Torch 1.9.0+CUDA 11.3
